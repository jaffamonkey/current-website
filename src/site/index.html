title: Testing everywhere
intro: |
    When I am adding tests and checks to design & development pipelines, or put a web/mobile app through an accessibility audit, itâ€™s backed by 25 years of freelancer experience. I work with transparency and a supportive approach, applying pragmatism to every testing decision.
