title: üòØ Oh! December already!
---

I could‚Äôve sworn there were 31 days in November‚Ä¶ But here we are on the 1st of December and I‚Äôm a day late with your newsletter! Three articles for you this month, though:

1. [Apple, you‚Äôre doing the Dynamic Island wrong](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/apple-youre-doing-the-dynamic-island-wrong)
2. [Upgrading from iPhone 13 mini to 16 Pro](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/upgrading-from-iphone-13-mini-to-16-pro)
3. [Avatars and alt text](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/avatars-and-alt-text)


## From the archives

A reminder that well written form labels and hint text, coupled with helpful validation, is the best way to ensure users enter data in the correct format; the one thing not to do is to [meddle with the user‚Äôs input as they type](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/dont-meddle-with-user-input).


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs that I came across from around the web during November:

- [Two different kinds of ‚Äúfocusable‚Äù UI elements](https://yatil.net/blog/focusable-ui-elements)
- [Avoid Read-only Controls](https://adrianroselli.com/2024/11/avoid-read-only-controls.html)
- The [axe-con 2025 schedule](https://www.deque.com/axe-con/schedule/) has been released
- [Accessibility Challenges with Single Page Applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZbBRr78bM)
- [Beautiful focus outlines](https://medienbaecker.com/articles/focus-outlines)

Anyway, I‚Äôm off to check my to-do list for anything else I haven‚Äôt done because I thought it was the 31st of November today ü§£
