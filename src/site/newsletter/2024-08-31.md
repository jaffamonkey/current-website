title: ðŸ˜… Itâ€™s hard work taking a holiday!
---

Even the most relaxing holiday is bookended by what feels like more work than normal: making sure everything is in good shape before closing the laptop, then returning to the mountains of emails, and Slack messages. And I took *two* separate holidays in Augustâ€¦! Donâ€™t worry, though, I still managed to write you an article: [An enhancement to accessible responsive tables](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/an-enhancement-to-accessible-responsive-tables).


## From the archives

This monthâ€™s article came after some tinkering with JavaScript; those of you who know me will know that, while Iâ€™m pretty hot with HTML and CSS, JavaScript isnâ€™t a particular love of mine. But, for the first time in my career, I actually *enjoyed* writing it! So much so that thereâ€™s a [new category on my website](https://www.tempertemper.net/category/javascript)!

What other subjects do I write about? Unsurprisingly, accessibility features heavily, but why not have a flick through the [the full list of categories](https://www.tempertemper.net/categories) to see if thereâ€™s something else that tickles your fancy?


## Elsewhere on the  web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs from around the web that I read or watched during August:

- [A handful of reasons JavaScript wonâ€™t be available](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-handful-of-reasons-javascript-wont-be-available/)
- [Dialog dilemmas and modal mischief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZRp7yY8SS0)
- [The infuriating inefficiency of accessibility audits](https://yatil.net/blog/the-infuriating-inefficiency-of-accessibility-audits)
- [Accessibility site AppleVis wonâ€™t disappear after all](https://sixcolors.com/link/2024/08/accessibility-site-applevis-wont-disappear-after-all/)
- [Should design systems include problematic components and patterns?](https://amyhupe.co.uk/articles/should-design-sytsmes-include-anti-patterns/)

Anyway, I should probably get through some more of those unread messages! See you again at the end of September ðŸ“¨
