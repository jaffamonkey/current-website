What a month! I‚Äôve been on the road with work, delivering accessibility workshops and putting on accessibility empathy labs. I‚Äôve visited offices in London and Reading and next on the list are Barcelona and the nearby Sant Cugat del Vall√®s, and Manchester.

Because of all of the planning, preparation, and promotion I found myself without any time to write you an article during September. Fear not! I have a draft almost ready to publish, so keep your eyes peeled for that.


## From the archives

On my recent travels, I‚Äôve met so many great people who are keen on making their work more accessible. Some have been testing with screen reader software, and almost all of those people have fallen into that age-old trap of using the tab key to navigate. If you‚Äôre testing with a screen reader, I urge you: [don‚Äôt use the tab key](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/screen-reader-users-and-the-tab-key)!


## Elsewhere on the web

I might not have had much time to write, but I still read a lot! Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs from around the web that I came across during September:

- [TechShare Pro 2024 is coming up!](https://techsharepro.performedia.com/)
- [Apple‚Äôs AirPods Pro are now hearing aids!](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/hearing-health/)
- [0.5% of the Global Top 200 Websites Use Valid HTML](https://meiert.com/en/blog/html-conformance-2024/)!
- [What Is React.js?](https://briefs.video/videos/what-is-react/) (a gloriously snarky take on the framework)
- [Motion, parallax, and web accessibility](https://servicenow.iu.edu/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0025852)

Anyway, I need to make sure my passport is in date before flying out to Spain! See you again at the end of October ‚úàÔ∏è
