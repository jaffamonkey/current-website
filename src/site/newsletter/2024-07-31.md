title: 🏅 Going for gold!

The 2024 Olympic Games are upon us! I’m not particularly patriotic so it has been a good sit-back-and-enjoy experience so far. You’ll be happy to hear that, as well as watching the Games, I’ve also been doing a bit of writing: [User ‘wants’ versus accessibility](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/user-wants-versus-accessibility)


## From the archives

Over the last few weeks I’ve been doing a bit more development work than I normally do, and I had to remind myself of a few Git commands. Luckily, I wrote a bunch of [short posts about Git](https://www.tempertemper.net/category/git) a few years ago, which I used for reference. Maybe they’ll come in handy for you too?


## Elsewhere on the  web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs from around the web that I read or watched during July:

- [How To Make A Strong Case For Accessibility](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/06/how-make-strong-case-accessibility/)
- [The infuriating inefficiency of accessibility audits and what to do about it](https://yatil.net/blog/the-infuriating-inefficiency-of-accessibility-audits)
- [Dialog dilemmas and modal mischief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZRp7yY8SS0)
- [It’s about time I tried to explain what progressive enhancement actually is](https://piccalil.li/blog/its-about-time-i-tried-to-explain-what-progressive-enhancement-actually-is/)
- [Overlays Misunderstand Accessibility](https://www.joedolson.com/2024/07/overlays-misunderstand-accessibility/)

Anyway, I’m off to watch some more of the Games! See you again at the end of August! 🏋️🚴🏊
