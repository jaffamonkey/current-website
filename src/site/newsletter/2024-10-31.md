title: ðŸŽƒ Halloween and family time
---

After nearly 2 months on the road with work, including a trip to Spain, my feet are firmly back on the ground. Iâ€™ve missed spending time with the kids, so Iâ€™m enjoying the lead up to Halloween as they prepare the house and their costumes. Oh, also, wrote an article for you! This oneâ€™s all about [getting started with the NVDA screen reader](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/getting-started-with-nvda).


## From the archives

Iâ€™ve been doing a fair bit of iOS accessibility work lately and loads of accessibility best practices and WCAG rules donâ€™t (and often canâ€™t) apply. One of the more frustrating design issues I see is when buttons sit on top of an already interactive area, such as a tappable card. Hereâ€™s a thing I wrote a while back about why itâ€™s better to avoid [overlapping interactive areas](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/overlapping-interactive-areas).


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs from around the web that I came across during October:

- [In Defense, I Swear, of the Magic Mouseâ€™s Charging Port Placement](https://daringfireball.net/2024/10/in_defense_i_swear_of_the_magic_mouses_charging_port_placement)
- [Nobody talks about the real reason to use Tabs over Spaces](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/c8drjo/nobody_talks_about_the_real_reason_to_use_tabs/)
- [Apple Passwordsâ€™ Generated Strong Password Format](https://rmondello.com/2024/10/07/apple-passwords-generated-strong-password-format/)
- [HTML for people](https://htmlforpeople.com)
- [Eleventy 3.0.0 is out!](https://fosstodon.org/@eleventy/113233783051260916)

Anyway, Iâ€™m off to help the kids prepare for Halloween. See you again at the end of November ðŸ‘»
