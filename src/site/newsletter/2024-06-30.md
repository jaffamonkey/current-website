title: ‚úÖ Time to vote!
---

There‚Äôs a general election here in the UK in a few days‚Äô time; I‚Äôll be down at the local polling station early to cast my vote. Aside from that, I‚Äôll be putting the finishing touches to some blog posts I‚Äôve been writing: having published three posts last month, I‚Äôve got myself back into a bit of a rhythm!

1. [All I want from WWDC 2024](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/all-i-want-from-wwdc-2024)
2. [How to browse the web with the keyboard alone](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/how-to-browse-the-web-with-the-keyboard-alone)
3. [WWDC 2024 roundup](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/wwdc-2024-roundup)


## From the archives

Alongside writing about using the keyboard on its own to get around, I revisited my [Getting started with VoiceOver on macOS](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/getting-started-with-voiceover-on-macos) post, adding more detail on the configuration, and the difference between navigation and interaction. Give it a re-read!


## Elsewhere on the  web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs from around the web that I read, watched, or enjoyed all over again during June:

- [Intro to colour contrast](https://goodpractices.design/articles/colour-contrast)
- [Alt Text Selfies](https://alttextselfies.net/)
- [Creating a Culture of Accessibility](https://youtu.be/rMFoX0gzLfA) (this guy looks familiar ü§©)
- [New York Magazine lauds Vision Pro‚Äôs accessibility](https://sixcolors.com/link/2024/06/new-york-magazine-lauds-vision-pros-accessibility/)
- [BBC Online Football Tables](https://wearecolorblind.com/examples/bbc-online-football-tables/)

Anyway, I‚Äôm going to get back to those draft articles, and head to the ballot box on Thursday. See you again at the end of July! üó≥Ô∏è
