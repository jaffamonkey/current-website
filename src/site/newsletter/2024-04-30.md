We’ve had a lovely sunny day and 17°C today in the North East of England! After a long, gloomy winter, that bit of warmth and the longer days makes everything feel better.

But rain or shine, I’m still here scribbling my thoughts on accessibility, design, and web development for you; this month I wrote about when [an image is the first thing in a button or link](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/images-as-the-first-thing-in-a-button-or-link). Enjoy!


## From the archives

It’s Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD) on the 16th of May and some colleagues of mine have produced some really nice custom accessibility illustrations for us to use. We had a chat about colour contrast in illustrations, and I was reminded of a blog post I wrote back in 2022: [Images, illustrations, and contrast](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/images-illustrations-and-contrast).


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs from around the web that I read (and one or two that I re-read) during April:

- [The WebAIM Million](https://webaim.org/projects/million/)
- [Front-end development’s identity crisis](https://www.ellyloel.com/blog/front-end-development-s-identity-crisis/)
- [Newcastle United’s haptic shirts allow deaf fans to feel noise of St James’ Park](https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/newcastle-uniteds-new-haptic-shirts-28992244)
- [Setting up a screen reader testing environment on your computer](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/testing-environment-setup/)
- [“AI” won’t solve accessibility](https://yatil.net/blog/ai-wont-solve-accessibility)

Anyway, I’m off to get my light jacket on, take a walk around the block, and enjoy the last of today’s good weather; catch you again this time next month! 😎
