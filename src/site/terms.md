Terms and conditions are often tedious, and money can be a bit of an awkward thing to talk about. Before we go any further, in an attempt to not waste anyone's time, it's a good idea to let you know how I work.

I love what I do and take pride in having invested time, money and a great deal of energy into developing my skills as a quality assurance and testing expect. I'm constantly reading up on the latest developments in the testing space, brushing up my skills and challenging myself wherever possible. My inspiration in test automation came from Open source world.

In recent years, I've been doing shorted testing assignments - sometimes hands-on, sometimes as a coach/guide. A more recent specialty is Accessibility audits

## My approach

### Testing

I work in a very consultative manner in order to deliver your content to your users in the most effective way possible. I care about the testing and this means I often question or challenge ideas clients bring to me (very politely and diplomatically, of course; I'm far from the argumentative type!). Having said that, please don't be shy with *your* ideas: you know your business better than anyone!

### Quality assurance

As well as delivering website projects and working as a freelance, I also provide consultation, and tend to focus on my specialist area of accessibility, where I can:

- audit a product or service, finding accessibility issues, pinpointing the cause, and providing direction for a solution
- steer design and/or frontend development teams in accessibility best practices
- give advice and direction for positive change in accessibility on a departmental or organisational level

## Ways of working

I have worked with people all across the world on projects of all sizes.

### My location

I generally work remotely. Where absolutely necessary I will travel to your location; otherwise I will participate fully via video calls like [Zoom](https://zoom.us/), and messaging services like [Slack](https://slack.com).

### Asynchronicity

Working remotely is not just about location; it's about being timezone agnostic and asynchronous:

- Replies to emails and other messages will be timely but not immediate
- Calls should be pre-agreed
- Work should be tracked via tickets in a service like [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) or [GitHub](https://github.com)


## Cost

My fee depends on the type of work you'd like me to do and length of contract. When outlining what your project is, please give a clear expectation of **what** you would like me to do, **when** you'd like it to be done by, and the **budget** you have available.

As a rough, I charge Â£500 per day + VAT. 

### Ongoing retainers

I can work with clients on a regular basis, to assist during times when more test expertise and experience is required.

### Expenses

This is a rarity, but any unplanned travel costs would come under expenses.

### Negotiations

I am happy to negotiate, to a degree. For example, if your website or mobile app is particularly straightforward, then a lower price could be agreed.

If you simply haven't the budget for your needs, I can still work out a plan to maximise testing time to the fullest. For exmpmle, I can reduce time necessary by reducing effort on reporting, which is a time-consuming task, and keep it leaner.

I'm yet to come across a project with unlimited funds, so I'm well accustomed to working within the constraints of a set budget.

If your budget won't stretch to the total estimated project price, I'm happy to work with you to reduce the scope in a way that will allow us to work together.

A limited initial budget may mean a reduced initial amount of work followed by a series of regular monthly 'retainer' payments, allowing you to spread the cost (and the work) over a longer period.

It's not unheard of that a client comes to me wanting `A`, `B` and `C` and it turns out that `C` isn't necessary or will detract from `A` and `B`, somehow. If I see that this is the case, I'll let you know and we can reduce the scope of the project to just `A` and `B`. Having assumed `C` was going to be part of the project, you may have budget remaining that you'd still like to invest, in which case I can help advise you to maximise the return on revenue spent.


## Contract

I draw up a contract for every job I undertake. My contracts are in plain English (as little [legalese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_writing#Legalese) as I can get away with!) and ensure there will be no misunderstandings. They cover, among other things, what materials you'll give me so that I can do the job for you, a breakdown of the job itself, payment terms and details of copyright ownership.

### Consultation days

Sometimes the requirements and scope of a project are not known. If this is the case, I can work with you to produce them. My time for this is billable by the day, must be paid for up front, and is separate to any potential future project costs.


## What next?

So I hope there were no surprises there and everything was what you were expecting. If it all sounds good and, in principle, you're looking forward to us working together, [get in touch](/contact) and we can talk about your project!
