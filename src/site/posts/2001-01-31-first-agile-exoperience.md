I join Playstation on a contract in 2001, and they were operating a Scrum methodology.  Scrum quickly became the default for baffled project management, which fitted nicely into Agile vibe as it was light touch. Whilst not strictly, Agile, it was more Scrum-like projects, I subsequently realised people adopted these things as part of Agile (daily stand-ups, sprints, pair programming, etc).
