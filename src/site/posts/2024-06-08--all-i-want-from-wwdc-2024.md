Never mind all the hype around AI, there are only really two things I want Apple to announce as additions to their software offering at this year's WWDC:

- [Automatic Voice Memos transcription](/blog/if-only-apples-voice-memos-did-transcription) (please!)
- A stand-alone Passwords app

I've been [using Apple's built-in password manager for a couple of years](/blog/i-deleted-1password) now and it has been nothing if not reliable, but every now and then I encounter a hurdle.

Using Shortcuts, [I made a fake Passwords app](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/73729e64eab14dbf99b5fd74e7e41913), which comes in handy on iPhone, but on my Mac I launch most apps using Spotlight so I don't use the fake app on there. What does irk slightly is whenever I'm required to re-log in to a service in Internet Accounts; something like iCloud, my Google account, or an IMAP email account. Because Internet accounts and Passwords both live inside the same app (Settings) I have to:

1. Open Settings â†’ Passwords on a different device
2. Copy the password I need (which puts it in my [Universal Clipboard](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102430))
3. Paste it into the password field
4. Back on my other device, get the one-time code and either copy/paste it in similar fashion or just type it in

Not a huge deal, but not very slick. Passwords aren't a setting, so it's time Apple moved them into their own stand-alone app.

The good news is that [Apple might be granting my wish](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/06/gurman-passwords-app) at this year's WWDC. Fingers crossed!
