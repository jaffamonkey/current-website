Web Rotor is a feature available in VoiceOver and NVDA, which represents a page using categorised lists. It provides an easier way to navigate a web page with a screen reader using lists of headings, links, forms and other items on a web page. It's a great way to check how intuitive your site is, for screen reader users.
