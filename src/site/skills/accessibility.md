> The purpose of an Accessibility Audit is to establish how well a website or mobile app performs in terms of access and ease of use by a wide range of potential users, including people with disabilities such the visually impaired.

## Accessibility Standards
W3C specified the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.2) success criteria for Accessibility compliance. Following these guidelines will provide greater accessibility to a wider range of people with disabilities, across a range of devices (desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones).

## Key Benefits
> Inclusivity: Integrating accessibility ensures that digital products are usable by a wider audience, including individuals with disabilities.

> Legal Compliance: Adhering to accessibility standards like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) helps avoid legal repercussions associated with non-compliance.

>Improved User Experience: Accessible design often leads to better overall usability, benefiting all users, not just those with disabilities.

> Business Advantages: A broader audience and enhanced user satisfaction can translate into increased engagement and customer loyalty.

## Core areas checked

While it may seem as if the WCAG is focused on web, it's actually focused on content.  The same WCAG rules apply to both web and mobile apps.

- Listen to most of the web/mobile app using a screen reader
- Verify zoom in up to 200% without web/mobile app text spilling off the screen
- Navigate the web/mobileapp using keyboard
- UI color contrasts and clickable element sizings

## What you will get
- A full accessibility review and test of web or mobile app against the WCAG 2.2 AA standard.
- Delivery of a full, prioritized accessibility report of web and/or mobile app
- Feedback on UX as well as UI issues.
- An accessibility statement advising on status of WCAG 2.2 AA compliance.
- Automated accessibility test framework(s) for your design and development cycles. 
  _(some of the tools used are described on page about [checks done on this website](https://jaffamonkey.com/accessibility-checks))_
- Optional extra is devising a strategy, to aimed at integrating Accessibility checks as part of design and development cycles.

## What happens afterwards

A followup meeting happens after audit, which is a quick review of issues to check if there are any queries.

In terms of development, issues found during accessibility audits are straightforward simple fixes (does not require an expert developer, just one well versed with front-end coding fundamentals). How developers choose to approach these issues, will be very much part of your company's internal design/development cycles. Many of the issues are duplicated, so can be fixed at a template/component level.

> Treat an audit as a startpoint, to integrating accessibility checks earlier in the development lifecycle.
