## Accessibility audit

The purpose of an Accessibility Audit is to establish how well a website or mobile app performs in terms of access and ease of use by a wide range of potential users, including people with disabilities and the visually impaired. 

## Accessibility Standards
W3C specified the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.2) success criteria for Accessibility compliance. Following these guidelines will provide greater accessibility to a wider range of people with disabilities, across a range of devices (desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones).

## Key Benefits
> Inclusivity: Integrating accessibility ensures that digital products are usable by a wider audience, including individuals with disabilities.

> Legal Compliance: Adhering to accessibility standards like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) helps avoid legal repercussions associated with non-compliance.

>Improved User Experience: Accessible design often leads to better overall usability, benefiting all users, not just those with disabilities.

> Business Advantages: A broader audience and enhanced user satisfaction can translate into increased engagement and customer loyalty.

## What you will get
- A full accessibility review and test of web or mobile app against the WCAG 2.2 AA standard.
- Delivery of a full, prioritized accessibility report of web and/or mobile app
- Feedback on UX as well as UI issues.
- An accessibility statement advising on status of WCAG 2.2 AA compliance.
- Automated accessibility test framework(s) for your design and development cycles.
- Optional extra is devising a strategy, to aimed at integrating Accessibility checks as part of design and development cycles.

Treat an audit as a startpoint, to integrating accessibility checks earlier in the development lifecycle.
