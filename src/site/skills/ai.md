# 🎯 Overview
Your AI should be helpful, stable, compliant, and consistently on-brand — not unpredictable or fragile.

I help teams validate behaviour, fix reasoning gaps, improve tone, and ensure that the chatbot serves *all* users well.

# Services

## Automation & Reliability Testing
High-coverage testing based on real conversational behaviour.

- Multi-turn reasoning + memory retention checks  
- Hallucination and contradiction detection  
- Stress/latency testing and uptime monitoring  
- End-to-end flows that mimic actual user intent  
- Continuous verification tied to deployments  

## Conversational Behaviour Analysis
Deep testing of how your chatbot thinks and responds.

- Edge-case exploration  
- Long-form conversation stability  
- Consistency and narrative-drift detection  
- Guardrail enforcement  
- Tone stability and professional alignment  

## UX & Neurodivergent Accessibility
Testing built around real cognitive needs.

- Clarity and cognitive load evaluation  
- Friendly, predictable conversational patterns  
- Troubleshooting for overwhelm, loops, or ambiguity  
- Accessibility review of message structure and signposting  

## Personality & Tone Governance
Your bot should sound like *your brand*, not like 4 different interns arguing.

- Personality consistency checks  
- “Over-apology”, “over-confidence”, or “over-compliance” tuning  
- Phrasebook and tone-of-voice validation  
- Avoiding unintentional humour, sarcasm, or emotional weirdness
