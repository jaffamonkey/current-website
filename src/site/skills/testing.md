Startups make up the bulk of clients, and I enjoy working with that kind of vibe. But I cater for companies and projects of any size, delivering quality to the tightest of timescales. Testing is major part of quality engineering, an area of software development concerned strategies for quality assurance in product development and production. This is experience I bring to every project.

- Proof of concept test automation frameworks.
- Test strategies that will grow, as your way of working does.
- Quality checks at every step of the way, from design to production.
- Test automation that can live in the pipeline.
- Adding performance tests as part of CI.
- Exploratory testing, to find out what real users could come across.
- Leveraging AI to generate scenarios and test data.

## How does it work?

We can work out timescales and tasks, depending on your needs and budget. Whether you want a little help getting more automation in your pipeline, or need some general app performance checks, I can deliver results. 

This won't be done in isolation - it's not the 1990's; the way of working is about engagement with you and your team, to ensure you have input you need.

## Deliverables

- Adaptive test strategies.
- Applying quality checks from design through to development.
- UI test frameworks
- API test frameworks with service virtualization to ensure test continuity.
- Performance tests with every build to check Accessibility, Load and Security.
- Integration of tests into CI/CD pipelines.
