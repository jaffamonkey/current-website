This website was put together using the TemperTemper (an [Eleventy] theme). 

The build itself is taken care of by npm scripts and it's all [hosted on Netlify](/blog/moving-to-netlify).

## Styling

The styling is written in [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) with [Post CSS](https://postcss.org) being used to add vendor prefixes for deeper browser support.


## Scripts

There is only a tiny amount of JavaScript on this website; used to enhance some keyboard behaviour on links that look like buttons] for better accessibility.

## Accessibility

I use a variety of tools to keep the site accessible, including:

* [Lighthouse scores (Speedlify service](https://elegant-biscotti-25e1e9.netlify.app/jaffamonkey-website) 
* Pa11y Dashboard.
