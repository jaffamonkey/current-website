- Just back from two family holidays in August:
    1. Cantabria on the north coast of Spain; our new favourite place to go on holiday, with hot days, cool nights, and, weirdly, no mosquitos!
    2. Bamburgh in the far north-east of England, to stay in a holiday cottage with my parents, brother and nephew; what a beautiful part of the world!
- Several weeks later, still drowning in a mountain of emails having taken two separate weeks off during August…
- Enjoying the challenge of a 16 kilometre (each way) [cycle to the office](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1546555003560771585) twice a week even more now that the weather has improved
- When not at the office, getting up and going for a 5am run every morning
- Continuing to [stand, rather than sit, for work](https://mastodon.social/@tempertemper/110281662026715175), and absolutely smitten with my new [Apple Studio Display](https://www.apple.com/uk/studio-display/)
- Four years into the [daily cold showers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000v83f)
- Enjoying watching [my football team](https://www.newcastleunited.com) when I can
- Still playing Pokémon Go (I'm currently level 45), even though the kids' interest has waned slightly…
