title: The things I'm up to right now
intro: |
    You've seen my [blog](/blog/) and [about page](/about) so you know what I'm interested in and how I ended up doing what I do, but what am I up to *right now*?

- Enjoying the challenge of a 16 kilometre (each way) [cycle to the office](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1546555003560771585) twice a week even more now that the weather has improved
- When not at the office, getting up and going for a 5am run every morning
- Continuing to [stand, rather than sit, for work](https://mastodon.social/@tempertemper/110281662026715175), and absolutely smitten with my new [Apple Studio Display](https://www.apple.com/uk/studio-display/)
- Enjoying watching [my football team](https://www.newcastleunited.com) when I can (I managed to get tickets for four matches last season)
- Still playing Pokémon Go (I'm currently level 44), even though the kids' interest has waned slightly…
- I tend not to be too reflective when someone in the public eye dies, but I was very sad to hear about Michael Mosley; I've been listening to [his podcasts](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p09by3yy) for a long time, and am four years into the [daily cold showers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000v83f)
