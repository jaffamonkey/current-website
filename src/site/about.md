The challenges of testing provide technical and human puzzles. I am very technically-focused, but also adept with teams. I started out in the tail of of the 1990's, when Waterfall was still common and testing was judged by the weight of arch-lever file reports (only half-joking).  With my Agile project in 2002, I found more inspiration in testing - not least from opensource world. As technical demands on testers grew in the 00's, I grew with them. 

> As my site demonstrates, I am a minimalist - in life, and in work I learnt early on to take a lean approach to testing, to ensure minimal time-wasting. From working with many startups, I kept on improving on this heavily risk-based approach.

 From corporations trying to change at a faster pace, to startups looking for a rapid and flexible approach to testing,  I have learnt that testing can be improved and have positive effect on the rest of the project, whatever the challenges.
